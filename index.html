                   <h2>We, two friends<br> were forced to leave our homeland.</h2>  
                    <p> 
                        Facing the typical challenges of refugees—language and cultural barriers, feelings of alienation and loneliness—we were on the verge of depression. But we didn't want to give up.
                        Determined to overcome these difficulties, we started volunteering at the ABM restaurant. Here, we made our first acquaintances and then friends. Gradually, familiar faces appeared, and the feeling of loneliness began to fade. Regular interactions with colleagues helped us learn the language and integrate into the new society.

                    <p id="text1">Over time, we realized that we wanted to share this fascinating activity with others. This is how the idea of holding screen printing workshops was born. We especially wanted to organize them within the walls of our beloved ABM—a place that has become a safe haven for us, where we are understood and accepted.</p>
                    <p id="text2">For me, ABM played a crucial role in my integration and became my first work experience in the Netherlands. Thanks to the friendly and attentive approach of the ABM staff, we found the strength and new dreams. One of these dreams was screen printing. This hobby became a true discovery and source of joy for us. The entire process seemed magical, and we enjoyed learning and trying something new.</p>

                    <p id="text3">We believe that workshops at ABM will help people feel the same atmosphere of safety and acceptance that we found here. Our workshops will be a place where everyone can create their unique design and take home a piece of this special place, where they can truly be themselves.
